# üë®‚Äçüíº Employee Attrition Prediction Notebook  

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates how to use **Machine Learning & Data Visualization** techniques to predict **Employee Attrition (Yes/No)**.  
Employee attrition prediction helps organizations in:  
- Identifying employees likely to leave the company  
- Reducing recruitment & training costs  
- Taking proactive retention strategies based on data-driven insights  

The notebook walks through **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, and evaluation**.

## üìä Workflow  
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables (OneHotEncoder)  
   - Feature scaling for numeric variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Attrition distribution  
   - Attrition by department, job role, overtime, income, etc.  
   - Correlation analysis  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Compare models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
   - Select best-performing model  

5. **Prediction Pipeline**  
   - Save best model (`attrition_model.pkl`)  
   - Single employee attrition prediction example
